Overview

This project aims to be a small planetary orbital simulation using OGRE as a
Framework. It may grow from there, but today all that is planned will likely
serve as tutorial framework. Mostly, this is an excuse to play with some new
(to me) tools and libraries. Any reviews or suggestions are of course
appreciated.


Building

% cmake .
% make

Hopefully, that's it. Today, this is working on Linux, and I may get things
working on MacOS and/or Windows if time permits.


TODO

Ha! Everything?
* make cmake play nice with OGRE
* base Ogre Apllication
* star, planets, moons
** smaller satellites?
** stars plural?
* circular orbits
* calculated gravity based obits
* QT or GTK windowed niceties?
